Do you think that having a breadth of technical knowledge in different domains could help with a transition into #cybersecurity?

I know it sounds ridiculous but I was watching a YouTube video on malware and [[Malware#^bc586f|I thought about macOS disk images and pkg files, both of which are basically folders, or glorified containers]].

I wondered if you could possibly distribute [[Malware]] in either one of these containers, [[What is The Cyber Kill Chain and How to Use it Effectively#^4214be|specifically through pirated software]]. 

Ok great. Got the malware installed and it is executable. [[What is The Cyber Kill Chain and How to Use it Effectively#^666162|]].

There are three levels of permissions in Gatekeeper:

Only allow software from the Mac App Store
Allow installation from the MAS and identified developers 
Off

## Attacks

Prototype pollution
Race conditions
JWT vs Cookies vs base64 passwords
ORM attacks
Frontend Architecture

## Projects:

Tool that:
- Scan for SMB Shares
- Connect to them
- Inspect for hard coded creds
- Login as DA

throttling file size checks connections errors regex dir limits file limits logging

  

## C2 Servers:

- Catches shells
- serves files
- oob testing
- data exfiltration
- managing persistence

  
  

## AppSec Projects

- Malicious WordPress plugin
- Tool that scans the admin panel for ways to upload files

  

### Spin up an app for AppSec testing:

- Scan target
- Review results
- Gradually harden target
- Analysis and documentation

  

#### Build a SPA to attack:

- Prototype pollution
- Base64 JSON files
- JSON web tokens over a cookie in base64
- race conditions

## What kinds of ways are there to DDoS a target?

Try to find some articles and videos on the topic so you can experiment with your script.
[main.py](https://github.com/twhite96/ddos-script/blob/main/main.py)

- Could I use an `impacket` [[DDoS Script#^9418ad|class]] of some sort?
- Where can I find detailed information about using `impacket`?
- `socket` or `asyncio`?
