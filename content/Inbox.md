**C**onfidentiality,¬†**I**ntegrity and¬†**A**vailability (**CIA**) Triad

The¬†CIA¬†triad is unlike a traditional model where you have individual sections; instead, it is a continuous cycle. Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless (similar to the fire triangle). If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy.

**Confidentiality**

This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse. Organisations will always have some form of sensitive data stored on their systems. To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.

example, employee records and accounting documents will be considered sensitive. Confidentiality will be provided in the sense that only HR administrators will access employee records, where vetting and tight access controls are in place. Accounting records are less valuable (and therefore less sensitive), so not as stringent access controls would be in place for these documents.

**Integrity**

The¬†CIA¬†triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.

possible for the information to change because of careless access and use, errors in the information system, or unauthorized access and use. In the CIA triad, integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving modification to the information.

**Availability**

In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

## Security Models

**The Bell-La Padula M****odel**



The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined.

  

The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".

|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organizations hierarchies (and vice versa)<br> | Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect. |
| Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.                            |                                The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organization.                                 |

The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military. This is because members of the organisations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting.

**Biba Model**

The Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the¬†CIA¬†triad.

This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarised as "no write up, no read down". This rule means that subjects¬†**can**¬†create or write content to objects at or below their level but¬†**can only**¬†read the contents of objects above the subject's level.



| Advantages                                                                                                  |                                                              <div>Disadvantages</div>                                                               |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| This model is simple to implement.                                                                          |                  There will be many levels of access and objects. Things can be easily overlooked when applying security controls.                  |
| Resolves the limitations of the Bell-La Padula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity. | Often results in delays within a business. For example, a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model. |
