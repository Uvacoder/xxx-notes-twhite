| Iterator                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| input_iterator          | Read values with forward movement. These can be incremented, compared, and dereferenced.                                                                                                                   |
| output_iterator         | Write values with forward movement. These can be incremented and dereferenced.                                                                                                                             |
| forward_iterator        | Read or write values with forward movement. These combine the functionality of input and output iterators with the ability to store the iterators value.                                                   |
| bidirectional_iterator | Read and write values with forward and backward movement. These are like the forward iterators, but you can increment and decrement them.                                                                  |
| random_iterator         | Read and write values with random access. These are the most powerful iterators, combining the functionality of bidirectional iterators with the ability to do pointer arithmetic and pointer comparisons. |
| reverse_iterator        | Either a random iterator or a bidirectional iterator that moves in reverse direction.                                                                                                                      |


## Crawling through a file system

1. How can we use C++ iterators to infiltrate a system, traverse the filesystem and exfiltrate what we need, and close the backdoor without detection?

Can you memoize vector operations?
