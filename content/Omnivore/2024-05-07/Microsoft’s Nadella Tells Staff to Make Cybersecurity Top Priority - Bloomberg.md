## Highlights

> Facing harsh criticism for failing to contain several major cyberattacks, [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/msft:equity) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella sent a blunt message to his staff Friday urging them to make cybersecurity a top priority.
> 
> “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,” Nadella wrote in a companywide memo. “In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/microsoft-s-nadella-tells-staff-to-make-cybersecurity-top-priori-18f564bf39d#a77f1369-d7d3-47af-9d5d-2f973e72c41b)  ^a77f1369

I don't understand why this has not been a priority in the first place. Why didn't Nadella mention the acceleration of AI products like Bing Chat from OpenAI? Or the DALL-E upgrade?

Your products are critical infrastructure to governments across the world. You NEED to prioritize security. Period.
