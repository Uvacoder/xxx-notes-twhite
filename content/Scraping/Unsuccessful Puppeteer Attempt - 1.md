Take a look at the [[Buffer Dump|buffer dumps]] from my terminal, to see all the errors I came across.

## Some notes

I didn't handle the errors because I just wanted to play with Puppeteer.

I wonder if there was a Bot and/or DDoS protection from something like Cloudflare. If this is the case, it is a lose/lose for me.
