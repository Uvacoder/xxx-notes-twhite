# Zero Trust Networks

## Description

<p>This practical book provides a detailed explanation of the zero trust security model. Zero trust is a security paradigm shift that eliminates the concept of traditional perimeter-based security and requires you to "always assume breach" and "never trust but always verify." The updated edition offers more scenarios, real-world examples, and in-depth explanations of key concepts to help you fully comprehend the zero trust security architecture.</p><li>Examine fundamental concepts of zero trust security model, including trust engine, policy engine, and context aware agents</li><li>Understand how this model embeds security within the system's operation, with guided scenarios at the end of each chapter</li><li>Migrate from a perimeter-based network to a zero trust network in production</li><li>Explore case studies that provide insights into organizations' zero trust journeys</li><li>Learn about the various zero trust architectures, standards, and frameworks developed by NIST, CISA,...
